# LetterFinder
This JavaScript code snippet defines a function called letterFinder that helps you find a specific letter within a given word (string). The function takes two parameters: word (the string to search within) and letterToMatch (the letter you want to find within the word).
The function iterates through each character in the word, checking if it matches the letterToMatch. If a match is found, it logs a message indicating the letter's presence and its index within the word. If no match is found, it logs a message indicating that no match was found.

An additional feature of this code is that it stops searching as soon as it finds the first matching letter, improving efficiency by not continuing the search unnecessarily.
# Usage:
letterFinder('Atefeh', 't');

# Output Example:
Found the letter t at index 1

This code snippet is useful for quickly identifying the presence and location of specific letters within words, which can be handy in various programming and text-processing scenarios.
